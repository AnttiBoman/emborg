There are 7 base configurations and one composite configurations.
Before the start of testing, 'CONFIGS' is copied to 'configs'

The tests back up only this directory or the 'configs' subdirectory
    - need a controlled set of files to test manifest

test0:
    - backs up the ./configs directory
    - uses excludes to select which files to backup
    - uses default mount point

test1:
    - backs up the . directory
    - uses excludes to select which files to backup
    - does not use default mount point

test2:
    - backs up the . directory
    - uses encryption and passcommand
    - uses exclude_from to select which files to backup
    - does not use default mount point

test3:
    - backs up the . directory
    - uses encryption and passphrase
    - uses patterns with simple excludes to select which files to backup
    - does not use default mount point

test4:
    - backs up the ./configs directory
    - uses patterns with root and excludes to select which files to backup
    - sets working_dir to . (relative paths)
    - uses default mount point

test5
    - backs up the . directory
    - uses patterns with root, includes and excludes to select which files to 
      backup
    - uses default mount point

test6
    - backs up the . directory
    - uses patterns_from with root and excludes to select which files to backup
    - sets working_dir to . (relative paths)
    - uses default mount point

test7
    - backs up the . directory
    - uses patterns_from with root, includes and excludes to select which files 
      to backup
    - uses default mount point
